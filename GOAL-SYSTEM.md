# Goal Management System with PDCA

A complete transformation of the request management system into a goal-oriented system using the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology.

## üéØ **System Overview**

The Goal Management System simplifies the complex request workflow into a focused PDCA cycle while maintaining collaborative features like multi-assignee support, notifications, and department permissions.

## üìä **PDCA Workflow States**

- **Check** - Review and evaluation phase
- **Act** - Adjustment and completion phase
- **Completed** - Goal achieved
- **On Hold** - Temporarily paused
- **Cancelled** - Goal abandoned

## üõ†Ô∏è **Completed Components**
